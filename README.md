This project uses A* to find the optimal path from start to goal on four different map. 
Both Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance are used to experiment the effect of heuristic function on the performance of A* algorithm.
Both 4-way(north, east, south, west) and 8-way(north, east, south, west, north-east, south-east, north-west, south-west) are used to observe the optimal path reached.
